# Predictive Modelling of Taxi Tip Amounts

## Project Overview

This project aims to estimate the tip amount given to taxi drivers. The evaluation metric for model performance is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Objective

- Build a model to predict the tip amount.
- Use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the performance measure.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing using imputation and feature engineering.
- Application of XGBoost.
- Hyperparameter tuning using step-wise hyperopt.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Machine Learning (XGBoost, Scikit-learn)
- Hyperparameter optimization with hyperopt
